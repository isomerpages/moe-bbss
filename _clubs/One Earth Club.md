<p style="text-align: justify;">The One Earth Club wants to raise awareness of environmental issues that our world faces and to be proactive in maintaining and sustaining practices to save Mother Earth. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We, as a community, need to make a conscious effort to change. In One Earth Club, we believe that this change starts from the individual. From our planned activities, it is clear that we strive to do our best to save Mother Earth. In the year 2016, we would carry out pond and garden works in school every month. Plastic bottles recycling bins that are made up of used plastic bottles were done up by the members every Wednesday. Tree planting would be done once a year in school. This would then allow students to realise how tough it is for a tree seedling to grow and they will appreciate the greenery and its significance. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our One Earth Club activities are not restricted to the school compound. Outdoor opportunities have been provided like visit to Coney Island, MacRitchie treks, Pulau Bin treks, the overseas trips to Cameron Highlands and Bintan. We have also partnered International Coastal Cleanup and performed five Coastal Cleanups this year and we also involved the school and staff in this effort. We have partnered the English Language Drama and Debate Society (ELDDS), Modern Dance and Badminton Club to do beach cleaning. We have partnered the ELDDS to put up a short skit in My First Skool @Boon Lay. We took part in SGA’s Recycle Bin Design Competition. We have also participated in the Green School Competition which has given us both exposure and recognition. We have also partnered NParks for Nature in Community Programme. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One Earth Club aims to inspire the students and nurture our members to attain and develop love for the environment and to make a conscious effort in retaining what Mother Earth has given us. One Earth welcomes like-minded students who like to do their part for Mother Earth. </p>
