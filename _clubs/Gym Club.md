<p style="text-align: justify;">The club continues to provide personal training programmes to every student who signs up as a member. We have approximately 50 to 70 active members. Sports specific training programmes have been designed and carried out for our Badminton and Basketball Boys teams. The Gym has been given two more new sets of treadmill machines, new fit balls and aerobic stepping boards to facilitate better training programmes. Gym coach, Mr Chia, also loaned out several sets of TRX suspension systems to its members for their own training.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Gym Club operates daily from 2.00 pm to 5.00pm on Monday to Thursday, and 1.30pm to 4.30pm on Friday. Each student will be given his or her own prescribed exercise program according to his or her fitness condition. The trainings include body weight exercises, resistance band exercises, Gym-ball exercises, weight trainings and TRX Suspension System exercises. The purpose of these trainings are to enhance students fitness conditions and to improve their sports performance. Currently, the Gym Club has 50 odd registered members.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Gym Club also provide training guidance to the staff of the school too.</p>
