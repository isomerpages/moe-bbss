#### Our Vision

In line with Singapore's vision of becoming a Smart Nation, BBSS Robotics Club seeks to equip students with important 21st Century Competencies such as **_Critical and Inventive Thinking_**  skills as well as **_Communication, Collaboration and Information_** skills.

Learn to assemble robots, design robot creatures and program robotic movements! Find out all about drones and what makes them fly! We encourage teamwork and creativity while applying problem-solving skills and technical knowledge in order to learn more about the role of technology in our world!

#### Our Learning Platforms & Key Activities

Members of Robotics Club will have fun exploring different platforms of robotics, experimenting with ideas and solving problems. Our main learning platform will be on LEGO Mindstorms and members will also get opportunities to work on other projects involving Micro:bit, drones and more.

Members will also be engaged, motivated and challenged through participation in competitions! Members can gain the experience and opportunity to develop ideas and practical skills to solve real-life problems through competitions such as DrCT Challenge and National Robotics Programming Competition (NRPC).
