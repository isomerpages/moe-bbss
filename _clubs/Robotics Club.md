<h4>Our Vision</h4>
<p>In line with Singapore's vision of becoming a Smart Nation, BBSS Robotics
Club seeks to equip students with important 21st Century Competencies such
as<strong><em> Critical and Inventive Thinking</em></strong> skills as well
as <strong><em>Communication, Collaboration and Information</em></strong> skills,
self-directed learners and leaders.</p>
<p>Learn to assemble robots, design robot creatures and program robotic movements!
Find out all about drones and what makes them fly! We encourage teamwork
and creativity while applying problem-solving skills and technical knowledge
to learn more about the role of technology in our world!</p>
<p><strong><u>STEM Alignment:</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Our Objectives:&nbsp;</u></strong>
<br>To inculcate Emerging 21CC skills for every robotics member to be an empathetic
and active problem solver who champions environmental and sustainable innovation.</p>
<p><strong><u>Our Focus</u></strong>
<br>Developing a Sustainable City and Urban Landscape through innovation.
In School and Community. We use the word “SCAMPER” to merge (m) Modify
with our robotics CCA objectives. Using sustainable materials and python
programming and mobile apps programming to do a project with theme on sustainability</p>
<h4>Our Learning Platforms &amp; Key Activities</h4>
<p>Members of Robotics Club will have fun exploring different platforms of
robotics, experimenting with ideas and solving problems. Our main learning
platform will be on LEGO Mindstorms and members will also get opportunities
to work on other projects involving Python Programming, drones and more.</p>
<p>Members will also be engaged, motivated and challenged through participation
in competitions! Members can gain the experience and opportunity to develop
ideas and practical skills to solve real-life problems through competitions
and leadership training platforms.</p>
