<h3>About Media Club</h3>
<p>Media Club trains our members to be technology savvy, competent in the
use of photography and video equipment, with the edge to think out of the
box. Media Club offers an insight into what the cinematography and photography
world looks like. We also provide PA support during daily morning assemblies
and school events such as the Annual Awards Ceremony and National Day Celebrations.
Our members constantly attend training sessions and digital audio and image
processing workshops to enhance their skills and competency so as to se</p>
<p>Media Club also offers a wide variety of genres such as sports photography,
events and even macro photography. We are fully equipped with high-end
gears to capture the art of photography and camerawork in film-making.
Students will harness the skills of photo editing and film editing to document
various school events and to support major school events and functions.</p>
<p>On top of the technical skills acquired through weekly training, students
embark on project work and competitions. On the videography side of things,
students also learn to write, direct, shoot and edit their videos. Students
are also taught how to use supporting tools such as tripods, gimbals, and
stabilizers during production.</p>
<p>Overall, Media Club inculcates values and skills, such as thinking interdependently
and persisting - giving them a realistic insight into the world of production</p>
