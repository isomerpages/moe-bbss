# Co-Curricular Areas

### <u>Policy</u>


*   Every secondary school student will take on ONE activity only, which can be either a sport, a uniform group, a cultural activity or a club.

*   Students are encouraged to pursue and specialise in one CCA. However, if they wish, they may opt to switch CCAs during the transfer window.


| CCA Transfer window           | Students Eligible for transfer |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Term 2 Week 9 – 10 | Sec 2 - 3                      |
| Term 4 Week 6 – 7 (Post EYE)  | Sec 1 - 2                      |

* Sec 4/5 students are not expected to make any CCA transfer as they will be stepping down from April onwards.
