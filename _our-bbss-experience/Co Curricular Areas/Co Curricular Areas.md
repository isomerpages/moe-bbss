### <u>Policy</u>


*   Every secondary school student will take on ONE activity only, which can be either a sport, a uniform group, a cultural activity or a club.

*   Students are encouraged to pursue and specialise in one CCA. However, if they wish, they may opt to switch CCAs during the transfer window.
