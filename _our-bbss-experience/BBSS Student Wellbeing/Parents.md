|![](/images/Our%20BBSS%20Experience/BBSS%20Student%20Wellbeing/Parents/Principle.png)   | **C**yber **W**ellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. <br>It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace.<br>The focus of CW is about helping students to become responsible digital learners.  |


MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower them to take responsibility for their own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.  
  
Our school catagorised Cyber Wellness into 3 main areas for parents:

### <u>What is Cyber Wellness?</u>

### <u>Cyber Bullying</u>

#### **<u>Excessive Internet Use</u>**
