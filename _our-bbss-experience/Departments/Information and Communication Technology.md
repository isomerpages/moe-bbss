During the school closure stage, it is important for students to continue to be engaged in their learning and they can do so via the school’s E-portal. This exercise serves to test out our school’s preparedness and readiness in delivering online lessons and assignments for students. This exercise was conducted after SA1 for all students. Students were instructed to logon to the e-portal from home and access the E-learning packages and complete the learning tasks assigned to them. |
