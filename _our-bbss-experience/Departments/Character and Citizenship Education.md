### Our Goal:

<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal of CCE education is to develop the right values, dispositions, knowledge & competencies so as to build good character among students. Through the explicit teaching of CCE lessons and modules, students are taught on how they can engage their love for self, family, peers, community and country.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our students are also guided on how they can contribute back to the society by providing service for the school or external community through Values in Action (VIA) activities and projects. Through this platform, our students develop a strong sense of social emotional well-being and show care for fellow citizens by actively involved in helping others.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Social Emotional Learning (SEL) is foundational to nurturing mentally healthy and, socially emotionally competent learners, enabling them to thrive in the future. We reinforce the development of social and emotional competencies through the Guidance Areas - namely Sexuality Education, Education and Career Guidance and Cyber Wellness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The internationalisation programme at BBSS aims to develop the 21CC global awarenes and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities and deep end their commitment and rootedness in Singapore. Through the programme, our students could then establish friendships and network with their counterparts overs</p>


### Key Department Programmes and Activities:

<p style="text-align: justify;">In instilling a sense of responsibility towards the society and community, here are the programmes which our students have participated in: </p>

*   Self-initiated and teacher facilitated Values in Action programme at the different levels both local and overseas. Here our students are given opportunities to care and create environmental awareness, teaching of young children and showing care for the elderly in the community;
*   Fund raising projects such “Share A Meal” & “Bukit Batok CC Walkaton Project” throughout the year. 

Students’ emotional, ethical and social needs are built up through various programmes such as:  

*   Cyber Wellness lessons;
*   Career guidance lessons, career day, job-attachment, learning journey to post-secondary institutions; 
*   Sexuality education lesson; 
*   Assembly talks by representatives from the Singapore Prison, Health Promotion Board.   

<p style="text-align: justify;">In encouraging critical thinking and understanding issues from multiple perspectives, explicit teaching of CCE values are carried out through an effective and engaging curriculum by the form teachers. In addition, students are given opportunities to discuss current affairs and national concerns through classroom debates and commemoration of significant historical events such as the Racial Harmony Day and National Day. Through our programmes, we also hope that our students will learn to be respectful and appreciate the diversity of our society. As such, every international student is assigned a buddy and on a semestral basis, we organise learning journey for our international students and their buddies to significant local places of interest.</p>
