<h3>Department Brief</h3>
<p>The Mother Tongue department aims to instill in the students the love
for their Mother Tongue and attain proficiency in the languages. Through
organizing academic and enrichment programmes, the department nurtures
self-directed and life-long learners who can communicate effectively and
embrace their own Mother Tongue culture and&nbsp; the diversity of the
various cultures. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The MT teachers seek to create an immersive environment and provide authentic
opportunities for students to use Mother Tongue Language and experience
their own Mother Tongue culture. Activities such as the Mother Tongue Cultural
Camp and Mother Tongue Fortnight provide platforms for students to enjoy
using Mother Tongue language in authentic situations and participate in
meaningful and engaging activities and cultural/linguistic competitions.&nbsp;Besides
this, the celebration of the various traditional festivals (Chinese New
Year, Hari Raya Puasa and Deepavali) and the commemoration of Racial Harmony
Day are also platforms for our students to lead in the organizing of the
events. The department also seeks to enhance the students’ motivation in
reading by having an Instagram account “iyuedo” to promote engaging reading
activities. The Twinning Programme with Chongqing Nankai Secondary School
provides further opportunities for students to interact with students from
China and experience their local culture, widening their global perspectives.
Besides that, this programme also helps to deepen pupils’ commitment and
build a stronger sense of rootedness and belonging to Singapore. In the
Covid times, the ties continue to be strengthened through the virtual twinning
programmes.</p>
<p>Students are also given the opportunities to stretch their potential in
the language. This can be seen in the Higher Chinese interest group formed
to engage the Higher Chinese students in more cultural activities. Some
of the Malay students are also given the opportunity to be Malay Ambassadors
to further promote the use of Malay in our daily lives. Our Tamil students
also have the opportunities to showcase their talent in the variety of
external competitions.</p>
