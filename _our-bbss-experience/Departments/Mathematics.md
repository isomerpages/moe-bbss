### Department Brief

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Mathematics Department is committed to providing high-quality learning experiences and supporting our students in developing excellence in Mathematics. Mathematics teachers adopt the “Connecting the Dots using the 3E + P approach” to deepen the joy of learning in students. Teachers build on and emphasise the connections in different mathematical concepts and processes to bring about deeper meaning and appreciation of mathematics. The 3E represents Engage, Explore, Explain to bring about conceptual understanding; while the P represents Practice, ensuring procedural understanding.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Teachers facilitate student learning of mathematical concepts and processes, thinking skills and heuristics, and create opportunities for students to undertake problem solving with confidence and enjoyment. We encourage self-directed and reflective learning through varied teaching and assessment strategies, and infuse Habits of Mind into lessons to enhance content learning and foster meta-cognition. To inspire deeper insight and greater interest, students who have higher potential are also encouraged to take up challenges in representing the school in various national and international competitions such as the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad and the ICAS Mathematics Competition.</p>
