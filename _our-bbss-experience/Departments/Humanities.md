**Department Brief**

The Humanities Department embarks on a curriculum to develop in students an inquisitive mind through inquiry-based pedagogy and to make learning more real by providing authentic learning experiences. Throughout their four to five years of education in our school we aim to instill in students the need to care for the Earth, an appreciation of the past, culture and heritage and to develop a sense of belonging to Singapore.
