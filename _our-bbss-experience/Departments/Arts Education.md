#### Aesthetics Department&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: justify;">In line with our mission, to nurture self-directed BBSSians with the passion to appreciate and participate in the arts, we craft programmes that aim to enrich the studentsâ€™ learning experience and plant the seed in them for the passion for the arts. Students are given a variety of opportunities to be exposed to enriching arts experiences both during curriculum time (via Visual Arts and Music lessons) as well enrichments that they can draw inspirations from. Besides lessons in the classrooms, our music concerts, competitions and art exhibitions provide invaluable additional opportunities for students to find a passion for these subjects. We encourage students to showcase their work and boost their confidence by organising events like&nbsp; Airtime concerts, BBSS Got Talent, Arts Carnival, and arts showcase such as Rhapsody: A BBSS Journey.&nbsp; Assembly programmes and outings to watch musicals and plays also give our students opportunities to appreciate the arts as members of the audience. Care is taken to make sure that students are exposed to different art forms comprising dance, drama, music and visual arts.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our biennial musical, Metamorphosis, is the brainchild of many hearts and minds determined to grow the roots of BBSS arts scene and is an event the entire school community looks forward to every other year. Additionally, our arts instagram page, @echolites, offers yet another platform to showcase our students' talents in the arts. We aim to provide a vibrant arts experience for every student of the school.</p>

Highlighted below are some of the programs we carried out for our students in 2022

*   School Musical comprising of 6 Performing Arts Groups
