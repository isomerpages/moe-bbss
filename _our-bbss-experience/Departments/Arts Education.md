<h4>Aesthetics Department&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In line with our mission, to nurture self-directed BBSSians with the passion
to appreciate and participate in the arts, we craft programmes that aim
to enrich the studentsâ€™ learning experience and plant the seed in them
for the passion for the arts. Students are given a variety of opportunities
to be exposed to enriching arts experiences both during curriculum time
(via Visual Arts and Music lessons) as well enrichments that they can draw
inspirations from. Besides lessons in the classrooms, our music concerts,
competitions and art exhibitions provide invaluable additional opportunities
for students to find a passion for these subjects. We encourage students
to showcase their work and boost their confidence by organising events
like&nbsp; Airtime concerts, BBSS Got Talent, Arts Carnival, and arts showcase
such as Rhapsody: A BBSS Journey.&nbsp; Assembly programmes and outings
to watch musicals and plays also give our students opportunities to appreciate
the arts as members of the audience. Care is taken to make sure that students
are exposed to different art forms comprising dance, drama, music and visual
arts.</p>
<p>Our biennial musical, Metamorphosis, is the brainchild of many hearts
and minds determined to grow the roots of BBSS arts scene and is an event
the entire school community looks forward to every other year. Additionally,
our arts instagram page, @echolites, offers yet another platform to showcase
our students' talents in the arts. We aim to provide a vibrant arts experience
for every student of the school.</p>
<p>Highlighted below are some of the programs we carried out for our students
