<h4>Department Brief</h4>
<p>The English and Literature Department fosters the development of language
skills and 21st Century Competencies through various school programmes.
Such language exposure will provide students with ample opportunities to

<h4>English Language: Competent, Confident, and Global Learners</h4>
<p>The department organises and explores many activities to build on students’
confidence in using the language. The MOE English Language Syllabus 2020
provides six Principles of EL Teaching and Learning that guide all our
teaching and learning methods.</p>
<p>The six Principles of EL Teaching and Learning (CLLIPS) are enacted in
the following ways.</p>

<h4>Contextualisation</h4>
<p>Learning tasks and activities will be designed for pupils to learn the
language in authentic and meaningful contexts of use.</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Thematic Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>Language learning occurs as students explore themes such as Food and the
Heart, Man and Environment, and Sustainability. This makes language learning
relatable and authentic to students, builds their general knowledge and
real-world contexts vocabulary.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<h4>Learner-Centeredness</h4>
<p>Learners are at the centre of the teaching-learning process. Teaching
will be differentiated according to pupils’ needs, abilities and interests.</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Differentiated Instruction</strong>
</p>
<p>Teachers adopt various Differentiated Instruction (DI) practices by providing
variations of task, process and product to enable diverse learners to gain
mastery of language skills. Beyond classroom lessons, students are offered
a range of additional interest-based opportunities in areas such as drama,
creative writing and broadcasting.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<h4>Learning-focused Interaction</h4>
<p>The teacher will provide a rich environment for communication that will
explicitly foster listening and speaking skills and focus on the achievement
of the Learning Outcomes.</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Dialogic Talk Pedagogy</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the school’s Effective Communication Programme, students engage
in exploratory dialogic talk with peers and teachers on themes and language
learning, developing empathetic communication skills and collaborative
competencies. In addition, students are exposed to self-reflection and
peer-feedback processes on their presentation and communication skills.&nbsp;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<h4>Integration</h4>
<p>The areas of language learning – the receptive skills, the productive
skills, and grammar and vocabulary will be taught in an integrated way,
together with the use of relevant print and non-print resources, to provide
multiple perspectives and meaningful connections.</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Integrative Project Work</strong>
</p>
<p>Each cohort integrates reading, writing, speaking and listening skills
learned through self-directed learning project work, such as Storytelling
(Sec 1), Project Sparks (Sec 2), Newsroom (Sec 3) and Project Spotlight
(G1/NT).&nbsp;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<h4>Process Orientation</h4>
<p>The development of language skills and knowledge about language involves
the teaching of processes. The teacher will model and scaffold such processes
for pupils, while guiding them to put together their final spoken, written
and/or multimodal products.</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Formative Assessment and Reflection</strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to learning grammar in contexts, students also experience
explicit instruction of grammar knowledge and practical language skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>They engage in regular formative assessment of writing and oral communication,
increasing their self-awareness of their strengths, areas to improve in,
and strategies to continuously improve. This Effective Feedback process
aims to enable and empower our students as self-directed learners.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Regular journaling provides an opportunity for students to engage in self-monitoring
of their learning.</p>

<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<h4>Spiral Progression</h4>
<p>Skills, grammatical items, structures and various types of texts will
be taught, revised and revisited at increasing levels of difficulty and
sophistication.&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p><strong>Student-Friendly Learning Targets</strong>
</p>
<p>Students receive student-friendly learning targets to fully understand
the goals of lessons at their level. Teachers calibrate the challenge level
of classroom learning and assessment standards to suit the learning targets
at each level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a compulsory lower secondary Humanities subject, English Literature
provides students with opportunities to encounter diverse perspectives
through literary texts and develop analytical skills while making connections
between texts and self, others and the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students will take Literature at the G2 or G3 level at lower secondary.
Students taking predominantly G1 subjects will experience Literature through
the Humanities Exposure Modules (HEM). G3 Pure Literature is offered at
the upper secondary level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our goals for teaching and learning of English Literature at BBSS are
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Develop <strong>critical thinkers</strong> and <strong>effective communicators </strong>through
responding to literary texts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nurture students' <strong>values</strong> and <strong>empathy</strong> through
connecting text to life&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance students' <strong>global and cross-cultural literacy </strong>through
exposure to diverse texts from local and global contexts&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empower students to be <strong>self-directed readers and learners </strong>through
open-ended and meaningful learning experiences&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Students explore a wide range of poetry, prose and plays from Singapore
and across the world in their course of learning and respond in myriad
engaging ways including dialogic inquiry, critical analysis, creative writing,
and dramatic performances. Examples of texts studied include the following:</p>
