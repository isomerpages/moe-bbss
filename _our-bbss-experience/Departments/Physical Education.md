<h3>Department Brief</h3>
<p>The BBSS Physical Education Department is committed to providing fun and
engaging physical learning experience for the students through Games Concept
Approach and Sports Education Model. Students are exposed to at least 6
games during their stay with us, offering them a wide based experience
to fuel their interest in life-long recreational pursuit and be physically
engaged young individuals. Students are also given opportunities to development
their leadership abilities during PE lessons. They lead their peers during
warm up, take charge of their house teams and take turns to referee the
intra-class games. At the end of Semester One and Two, Inter-class games
are organised by our student leaders as a platform for the students to
compete with other classes in both sports and recreational games such as
Jenga and Scrabble.</p>
