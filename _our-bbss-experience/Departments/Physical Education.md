### Department Brief

The BBSS Physical Education Department is committed to providing fun and engaging physical learning experience for the students through Games Concept Approach and Sports Education Model. Students are exposed to at least 6 games during their stay with us, offering them a wide based experience to fuel their interest in life-long recreational pursuit and be physically engaged young individuals. Students are also given opportunities to development their leadership abilities during PE lessons. They lead their peers during warm up, take charge of their house teams and take turns to referee the intra-class games. At the end of Semester One and Two, Inter-class games are organised by our student leaders as a platform for the students to compete with other classes in both sports and recreational games such as Jenga and Scrabble.
