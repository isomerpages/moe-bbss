<h1>Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Youth Leadership</h1>
<h3>Mission:</h3>
<p>To nurture a RESPECTful Leader who is confident and self-directed in serving
the community with abundance mentality.</p>
<h3>Our Focus:</h3>
<p>BBSS Learning for Life Programme (LLP) focuses in the area of Community
Youth Leadership which offers students opportunities to develop their leadership
character and values through serving the community. Undergirded by the
Habits of Mind Programme, the LLP encompasses the twin components of Leadership
Development Programme and Values-In-Action (VIA) Programme via two tiers.
Tier 1 experiences provide broad-based opportunities for all students,
while Tier 2 experiences cater to a specific group of students with higher
interest and ability. These two tiers comprise three developmental stages
whereby the students first discover their strengths, develop their leadership
skills and subsequently lead their peers.</p>

<p>The student council plays a pivotal role in our school community. As the
official representative of the students, they actively engage with their
peers, advocating for their concerns and needs through initiatives like
the Student Voice Project. Beyond voicing these concerns, the student council
also actively participates in school events, including the Annual Award
Ceremony, where they provide valuable service and contribute to the overall
vibrancy of our school life.</p>
