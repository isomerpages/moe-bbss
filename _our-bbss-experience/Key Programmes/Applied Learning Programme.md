# Applied Learning Programme

#### (STEM-Environment Education)

| Objective       | 
|:--------------:|
| Developing Empathetic Problem Solvers in STEM-Environmental Education Innovation |

| Our Focus       | 
|:--------------:|
| Our ALP focuses on developing empathetic problem-solvers through Design Thinking, integrating STEM education with environmental sustainability. Students progress through thoughtfully designed experiences across their years in BBSS. Secondary 1 students explore Code For Fun and AI applications, while Secondary 2 students engage in the BBSS Legacy Trail redesign project. Upper secondary students collaborate with industry partners like polytechnics, A*STAR, and Infineon Technologies on advanced STEM projects. From 2025, we're expanding our horizons through international partnerships with overseas schools, offering students global perspectives on STEM and environmental solutions.

### **4 Thinking and Learning Methodologies**

In ALP, we develop empathetic problem-solvers through four key thinking and learning methodologies, with Design Thinking as our primary approach. Through Design Thinking, students learn to understand user needs, ideate solutions and create prototypes iteratively, while Computational Thinking enables them to tackle complex environmental challenges through pattern recognition and algorithmic thinking. These are enhanced by Reflective Thinking, where students employ the '3-Selfs' (self-assessment, self-monitoring and self-modification) to build metacognitive skills and learning ownership.

  
Inquiry-based Learning supports these methodologies as students progress from basic coding and AI applications in Secondary 1 to complex environmental projects in upper secondary. Through systematic investigations and partnerships with industry experts, students develop critical thinking skills while applying their learning to real-world challenges. This progressive journey builds a robust foundation for our students to become environmentally conscious problem-solvers who can effectively address sustainability challenges both locally and globally.
