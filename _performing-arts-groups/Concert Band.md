### About Us

BBSS Concert Band strives to create a supportive atmosphere where students can extend themselves and grow as musicians and as individuals, while at the same time striving for the highest level of musicianship possible. 
  
Through active participation, students will explore a variety of musical styles and genres. Rehearsals and performances seek to enhance students’ aesthetic awareness and perception.
