<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>BBSS Modern Dance, Ikigai, is a tightly knit club that never fails to
inculcate the love of dancing in its members. The dancers work towards
a common goal of attaining excellence, and in the process, stronger bonds
are forged as they strive to overcome various obstacles and challenges
as a family. BBSS Modern Dance promotes dance as a form of art beyond its
aesthetic value. A strong set of values is imbued in every BBSS dancer
as they embark on this journey, enabling them to discover their potential
beyond dance. The club also emphasises on promoting physical fitness and
developing the studentsâ€™ dance techniques and stage presentation. Through
these sessions, students are trained to become vivacious and passionate
dancers.</p>
<p>Since 2020, the dance club has shifted its genre of dance to urban dance.
This move aimed at developing the strength the dancers had in this genre.</p>
<p>In 2023, our students participated in the SYF and attained a Certificate
of Accomplishment. The training for SYF strengthened our bond as a team
and provided our students the opportunity to showcase their skills, thus
building confidence and self-esteem. The dancers also put up a great show
for school events such as Chinese New Year celebrations and National Day
celebrations. We also contribute to the Bukit Batok Community by being
part of the community events such as the Hari Raya Celebrations.</p>
