### About Us

<p style="text-align: justify;">BBSS Modern Dance, Ikigai, is a tightly knit club that never fails to inculcate the love of dancing in its members. The dancers work towards a common goal of attaining excellence, and in the process, stronger bonds are forged as they strive to overcome various obstacles and challenges as a family. BBSS Modern Dance promotes dance as a form of art beyond its aesthetic value. A strong set of values is imbued in every BBSS dancer as they embark on this journey, enabling them to discover their potential beyond dance. The club also emphasises on promoting physical fitness and developing the studentsâ€™ dance techniques and stage presentation. Through these sessions, students are trained to become vivacious and passionate dancers.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2020, the dance club has shifted its genre of dance to urban dance. This move aimed at developing the strength the dancers had in this genre.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2023, our students participated in the SYF and attained a Certificate of Accomplishment. The training for SYF strengthened our bond as a team and provided our students the opportunity to showcase their skills, thus building confidence and self-esteem. The dancers also put up a great show for school events such as Chinese New Year celebrations and National Day celebrations. We also contribute to the Bukit Batok Community by being part of the community events such as the Hari Raya Celebrations.</p>
