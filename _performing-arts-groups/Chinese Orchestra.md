### About us

<p style="text-align: justify;">BBSS Chinese Orchestra seeks to promote greater appreciation of Chinese Orchestral music and culture and to nurture and groom young musical talents. Students musicians are given many opportunities to develop themselves musically through participation in instrumental master classes conducted by our instructors. With the guidance and the provision of the instruments for their patience, students will be able to build their interest and passion in music.  </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Joining the Chinese Orchestra has enabled many of our students to develop the skill of being able to play a&nbsp;Chinese instrument. The commitment, perseverance and the need to work together as a team to improve one's skill also enhances the maturity of our members, thus building their confidence and self-esteem. Through this learning journey, students pick up valuable leadership skills and cultivate a habit of continual practice and independent learning as they have to be self-directed in their learning beyond practices in school. With the skills that they hone through their experience in CO, they are also able to use it for their Direct School Admission (DSA) application for next educational pathway in their choice Junior College (JC).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Chinese Orchestra has taken part in a number of competitions to hone their skills. Awarded with the 4th Distinction in a row for the SYF Arts Presentation, our students get opportunities to hone their musical skills through performances. As one of the most active performing arts groups in our school, students get the opportunities to perform for the annual Chinese New Year Celebrations and biannual combined PAG concert, Metamorphosis. Other than indoor and outdoor performances at notable venues, they also engage in creative expression of music as they challenge themselves to prevent popular music using traditional instruments in school.</p>
