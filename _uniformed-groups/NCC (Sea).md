### Objectives

<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Cadet Corps (NCC Sea) is a platform for cadets to bond, learn and participate in numerous activities, which stretch them both mentally and physically. We aim to develop resourceful, responsible, resilient and committed leaders and team players. This is also in line with NCC Cadet Strong Framework where an NCC cadet is ‘Cadet Strong’, with a resilient mind, fit body and committed heart. </p>


<p style="text-align: justify;">We want to develop all of them into strong leaders with good character. To achieve this, our cadets are given opportunities to challenge themselves and grow from the experience. They take part in activities designed to push them out of their comfort zone, with safety as the main priority.</p>


### Signature Events

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a Sea unit, we leverage on various water activities to build self-confidence, physical dexterity, situational awareness, teamwork and mental resilience.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our water activities include kayaking, dragon-boating and sailing. We have planned out several kayaking milestones for each level of our cadets’ progression. </p>

  

Junior Cadet (Sec 1): Kayaking One-Star Certification   
Senior Cadet (Sec 2): Kayaking Two-Star Certification    
Cadet Leaders (Sec 3): 36km Mini Kayaking Expedition (MKE) and 100 km Annual Kayaking Expedition (AKE)   
Senior Cadet Leaders (SCLs): Expedition planning and execution at Kallang Sea Training Centre (KSTC)

Before 2020, our cadets participated in several NCC HQ overseas activities. These include:

*   Overseas mountaineering expeditions to Mt. Ophir
    
*   International Cadet Exchange Programmes (ICEP) to Brunei, Hong Kong, India, United Kingdom and United States of America as an opportunity to interact with and exchange ideas with overseas military cadets. Our cadets also host these foreign cadets when they come to Singapore for the exchange programme in Singapore.
    
*   Midshipman Training Deployment (MSTD) as an opportunity to travel with the Republic of Singapore Navy Officer cadets on board their sea missions.
