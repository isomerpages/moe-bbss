<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bukit Batok Secondary School National Police Cadet Corps unit was founded in 1986.  This year, in 2019, we welcome our 30th batch of cadets. NPCC is a well-rounded and enriching co-curricular activity. It is one in which cadets learn to develop an ardent love for the country, give back to the wider community and mature into a leader. The unit seeks to provide a holistic training environment for all cadets with an emphasis in character building and leadership development. We believe strongly that the values taught and learnt by the cadets is far more important than any attainment that can be given. The unit was awarded the <b>Gold Award for the 2019-2021 Unit Overall Proficiency Award</b>. </p>

**Vision and Mission:**

Vision: To provide quality experience for every cadet

Mission: To nurture self-directed cadets with abundance mentality

<p style="text-align: justify;">To achieve this, the unit exposes cadets to a myriad of activities ranging from police knowledge courses, weaponry training, to leadership development experiences. Our cadets also undergo rigorous training during their four-year stint, which includes physical fitness, footdrills, campcraft skills, adventure camps and various shooting competitions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2012, the unit has spearheaded Project Mi, a student-led Values-In-Action (VIA) initiative, during which BBSS students visit nearby neighbourhood to collect uncooked rice donations, which are donated to the needy. Through these activities and programmes, BBSS NPCC hopes to inculcate values such as discipline, loyalty, integrity, resilience and a sense of service in its cadets.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to inspire the cadets in their individual quests for excellence, their achievements are acknowledged through the award of skill proficiency badges and rank promotions.</p>
