<p>The Bukit Batok Secondary School National Police Cadet Corps unit was
founded in 1986.&nbsp; This year, in 2019, we welcome our 30th batch of
cadets. NPCC is a well-rounded and enriching co-curricular activity. It
is one in which cadets learn to develop an ardent love for the country,
give back to the wider community and mature into a leader. The unit seeks
to provide a holistic training environment for all cadets with an emphasis
in character building and leadership development. We believe strongly that
the values taught and learnt by the cadets is far more important than any
attainment that can be given. The unit was awarded the&nbsp;<strong>Gold Award for the 2019-2022 Unit Overall Proficiency Award</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
