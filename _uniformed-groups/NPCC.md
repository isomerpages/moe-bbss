<p>Since its founding in 1986, the Bukit Batok Secondary School National
Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) unit continues to shape young leaders, welcoming
its 36th batch of cadets in 2025. NPCC is a dynamic and enriching co-curricular
activity where cadets develop a strong sense of patriotism, actively contribute
to the community, and grow into capable leaders. The unit's holistic training
program prioritises character building and leadership development, evidenced
by its consistent achievement of Distinction in the Unit Overall Proficiency
Award for five consecutive years (2019-2024).</p>
