**Our Core**

<p style="text-align: justify;">The 53rd&nbsp;Boysâ€™ Brigade Company strongly believes in servanthood leadership and our core values include obedience, reverence, discipline and self-respect. Our BB Boys are nurtured to be faithful in what is entrusted to them and to be committed to the organisation. We train with utmost excellence and take pride in what we do.

**Our Company Achievements**

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For 2022 to 2023, our company has attained the <b>James Milner Fraser - High Distinction</b>. This award goes to the top-performing BB Companies in Singapore. Our company has received this award or equivalent since 2016.</p>

  

**Our Boys' Achievements**

<p style="text-align: justify;">We are proud to announce&nbsp; that we have three BB Boys who received the Founder's Award in 2023. The Founder's Award is the pinnacle of awards achievable&nbsp;at the Secondary School level.</p>

**Our Holistic Curriculum**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our BB Officers design BB camps to suit the needs of our BB Boys. Our Recruit and Company Training Camps, including our Leadership Training and Development Camps, focus on building tenacity and teamwork. They provide opportunities for the holistic development of our BB Boys as we observe them engaging in active collaboration and progress to become more confident individuals.</p>

  

<p style="text-align: justify;">To further help them in this holistic development, we send our BB Boys for proper certification in Kayaking and First Aid. Moreover, we conduct intentional mentoring programmes for selected BB Boys to stretch them.</p>

  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Service to the community is another crucial component of our BB programme. In December, we are actively involved in the BB Share-a-Gift project. The Boys develop empathy and kindness as they help the underprivileged.</p>

  

<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, to help the BB Boys face the Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous (VUCA) world, we constantly engage stakeholders too. We host purposeful engagements for parents and guardians during our camps and conferences and occasionally partner with the BBSS Parents Support Group (PSG). We are currently exploring programming in our BB curriculum and social entrepreneurship as we strive to stay current with the trends in the education scene.</p>
