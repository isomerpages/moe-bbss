<p>Introduced in 2004, the DSA scheme seeks to promote holistic education
and provide students with an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse
range of achievements and talent when seeking admission to a secondary
school.</p>
<p>At Bukit Batok Secondary School (BBSS), we believe that every child is
unique and has innate abilities to be developed. Our school values, mission
and vision, represent our collective passion, dreams and aspirations, and
guide us in how we work with our parents, community and partners to realise
the full potential of our students. We endeavour to build a culture of
self-directedness and abundance mentality amongst staff and students. Children
are firmly at the heart of our work and we seek to develop the whole child
by providing meaningful and connected learning experiences that will allow
every BBSSian to develop the right values, competencies and skills to do
well in the 21st century.</p>
<h4>DSA to Bukit Batok Secondary School</h4>
<p>We are looking for promising Primary 6 students who demonstrate talent
in the following 4 groups of talent areas that are open for DSA.</p>
