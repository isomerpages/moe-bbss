*Rooted in Strength, Growing Together*

Dear Parents, Students, and Community Partners,

<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to another exciting school year at Bukit Batok Secondary School! This year, our theme ***Rooted in Strength, Growing Together*** embodies the journey we undertake as a school community — rooted in our values, united in our mission, and committed to growth. </p>

### A Place to Flourish
<p style="text-align: justify;">At BBSS, we believe every student is unique, with individual strengths and needs. Our inclusive and supportive school environment ensures that all students are given the opportunity to thrive. Through the efforts of our dedicated Student Development Team, teachers, student leaders, and peer support programmes, we focus on the holistic well-being of each BBSSian — nurturing their cognitive, psychological, physical, and social well-being. Together with the support of our parents, stakeholders, and partners, we work to provide the best possible environment for every student to flourish. </p>

### Motivated Learners with Voice
<p style="text-align: justify;">We strive to empower our students to become motivated learners who are equipped with the 21st-century skills needed to be future ready. Through signature programmes such as Community Youth Leadership, STEM-Environmental Education, we provide opportunities for BBSSians to engage meaningfully with the world around them. In 2025, the school embarks on an exciting journey to harness Student Voice to dream and rebuild the learning spaces in the school through a Design Thinking approach. Our renewed focus on civic and cross-cultural literacies, facilitated through the school’s heritage curriculum and enriching overseas cultural learning trips to China, Japan, and ASEAN countries, allows students to broaden their perspectives and develop into informed global citizens.</p>

### Be Our Best, for Good
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are deeply privileged to be the school built for the Bukit Batok community when the Township was founded, and we remain committed to embodying the ethos of being the ***School on a Hill***. Through our Community Youth Leadership programme, we teach BBSSians the true meaning of service, participation, and building a better society. It is through this deep-rooted sense of purpose that our students learn about making a positive difference for a greater good.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our staff community stands strong, embracing the vision for 2025, drawing strength from one another as we grow together in this learning community. Thank you for your continued trust and partnership as we embark on this exciting journey of growth and discovery. </p>

Let us move forward together, **rooted in strength, growing together.**
