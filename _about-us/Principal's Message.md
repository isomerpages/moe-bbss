### A Legacy of Excellence
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the 8th Principal of Bukit Batok Secondary School, I am humbled and very zestful to step into this role, to build upon legacy of excellence established by my predecessor Mr Phua Huat Chuan and esteemed principals before me. For 37 years, BBSS has been known in the community to be a school that provides quality holistic education.  </p>

### Honoring our Heritage, Inspiring the Future
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bukit Batok holds a special place in Singapore’s history. The iconic Old Ford Factory stands as a testament to our nation’s resilience and the dawn of a new era, which ultimately saw Singapore’s independence post World War II. Founded in 1986, Bukit Batok Secondary School stands proud as the school built for this township, with a heritage of serving and growing with the Bukit Batok community. As a school rooted in this rich heritage, we proudly carry the torch of nurturing R.E.S.P.E.C.T.ful leaders – self-directed and confident youths who contribute meaningfully to our society and the future of Singapore..</p>

### Every Child Is Unique, Every Talent Flourishes
<p style="text-align: justify;">The school’s philosophy is grounded on the belief that every <b>child is unique and has innate abilities to be developed</b>. This philosophy resonates with my education leadership beliefs in nurturing the holistic development of every child, recognising that every child is different, with their unique strengths, interests and needs. As a mother of 2 and an educator having over 2 decades of teaching, leadership and service in various schools and at the Ministry of education headquarters, has only strengthened this conviction that every child can and wants to learn. We eagerly look forward implementing Full Subject Based Banding in 2024. Together with our dedicated team at BBSS, we are committed to designing engaging learning experiences that cater to diverse learners, so that each student finds purpose, engagement and growth in their education journey.  </p>

### Be Our Best, for Good
<p style="text-align: justify;">BBSS education challenges our students in being and becoming their best selves for the greater good, so that they can contribute purposefully to community. Together with my team, we remain steadfast in our mission to <b>nurture BBSSians to be self-directed learners with abundance mentality</b>. With the school’s academic and student development programmes carefully designed to engage BBSSians, they will be able to embrace their future with confidence and grace. I believe that BBSS will provide a caring and supportive environment that allows students to develop values, dispositions, wellbeing skills, a growth mindset that they can <b>Be Our Best</b> for good.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">BBSS has stood the test of time as an excellent school and I look forward to working with my Vice Principals, staff and stakeholders in our community in steering the school towards even greater heights. </p>

Have a meaningful and positive 2024!

Mrs Shirley Lee
