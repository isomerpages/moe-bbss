<p>Welcome to a new school year at Bukit Batok Secondary School! In 2026,
as we commemorate <strong>40 years of Home, Heart and Heritage</strong>,
our school theme for the year <strong><em>School on the Hill – Building a We First Community</em></strong> reflects
both our history and our shared aspirations for the future. For four decades,
BBSS has grown alongside the community &nbsp;— shaped by collective effort,
strengthened through relationships, and guided by our school philosophy
that there is a star in every learner, a belief that every child matters.</p>
<h4><strong>A School where Every Student Thrives</strong></h4>
<p>At BBSS, we believe that students learn best when they feel <strong>happy, safe and belonged</strong>.
Our culture is grounded in <strong>Positive Education</strong>, where learning
and wellbeing go hand in hand. We build this intentionally — by shaping
mindsets, dispositions and values, providing authentic platforms for students
to contribute, and equipping them with the skills to care for self and
others. Through our collective efforts of our teachers, Student Development
Team, student leaders and peer support structures, initiatives such as <strong>Project PEER</strong> prepares
our students to contribute to a We First community. In partnership with
our parents and community partners, we strive to create an inclusive environment
where every BBSSian feels seen, valued and supported, and is able to thrive
— academically, socially and emotionally.</p>
<h4><strong>Nurturing Learning Mindsets that are Future Ready</strong></h4>
<p>Our emphasis on <strong>learning mindsets</strong> and an <strong>abundance mentality</strong> encourages
students to see challenges as opportunities for growth and to recognise
that success is strengthened when we help one another. Our curriculum and
programmes are designed to develop <strong>21st Century Competencies</strong>,
equipping BBSSians with critical and adaptive thinking, communication,
collaboration and civic literacy skills to navigate an increasingly complex
world. Through signature programmes such as <strong>Community Youth Leadership</strong> and <strong>STEM–Environmental Education</strong>,
students engage meaningfully with real-world issues and apply their learning
with purpose and responsibility. In a rapidly evolving digital landscape,
we embrace <strong>technology and AI</strong> thoughtfully as enablers of
learning — guided by clear values and ethical use — supporting students
to become discerning, responsible users of digital tools while remaining
grounded in human connection, thinking and care.</p>
<h4><strong>School on the Hill- 40 years of Heart, Home and Hertiage</strong></h4>
<p>Our school colours<em>, </em><strong><em>Red and Gold</em></strong>, reflect
who we are. Red represents the warmth of community, while Gold symbolises
the hopes, dreams and rewards that come from sustained effort and growth.
Anchored by our school motto, <strong><em>Be Our Best</em>,</strong> we encourage
every BBSSian to strive for continual improvement — not in competition
with others, but in commitment to personal growth and collective success.
The call to build a <em>We First</em> society also reflects our shared national
ethos, echoed in our broader Singapore discourse — that progress is strongest
when we act with responsibility, care and concern for one another.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, we honour the heritage that has shaped us and remain
focused on building a school where every student can learn, grow and belong.
We thank our parents, alumni and community partners for your continued
trust and partnership as we journey as a <strong><em>School on the Hill</em></strong> &nbsp;together.</p>
<p>Warm regards,
<br><strong>Mrs Shirley Lee</strong>
<br>Principal
<br>Bukit Batok Secondary School</p>
