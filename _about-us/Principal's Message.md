<p><strong> Mrs Shirley Lee<br>Principal, Bukit Batok Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Rooted in Strength, Growing Together</em>
</p>
<p>Dear Parents, Students, and Community Partners,</p>
<p>Welcome to another exciting school year at Bukit Batok Secondary School!
This year, our theme <strong><em>Rooted in Strength, Growing Together </em></strong>embodies
the journey we undertake as a school community — rooted in our values,
united in our mission, and committed to growth.</p>
<h3>A Place to Flourish</h3>
<p>At BBSS, we believe every student is unique, with individual strengths
and needs. Our inclusive and supportive school environment ensures that
all students are given the opportunity to thrive. Through the efforts of
our dedicated Student Development Team, teachers, student leaders, and
peer support programmes, we focus on the holistic well-being of each BBSSian
— nurturing their cognitive, psychological, physical, and social well-being.
Together with the support of our parents, stakeholders, and partners, we
work to provide the best possible environment for every student to flourish.</p>
<h3>Motivated Learners with Voice</h3>
<p>We strive to empower our students to become motivated learners who are
equipped with the 21st-century skills needed to be future ready. Through
signature programmes such as Community Youth Leadership, STEM-Environmental
Education, we provide opportunities for BBSSians to engage meaningfully
with the world around them. In 2025, the school embarks on an exciting
journey to harness Student Voice to dream and rebuild the learning spaces
in the school through a Design Thinking approach. Our renewed focus on
civic and cross-cultural literacies, facilitated through the school’s heritage
curriculum and enriching overseas cultural learning trips to China, Japan,
and ASEAN countries, allows students to broaden their perspectives and
develop into informed global citizens.</p>
<h3>Be Our Best, for Good</h3>
<p>We are deeply privileged to be the school built for the Bukit Batok community
when the Township was founded, and we remain committed to embodying the
ethos of being the <strong><em>School on a Hill</em></strong>. Through our
Community Youth Leadership programme, we teach BBSSians the true meaning
of service, participation, and building a better society. It is through
this deep-rooted sense of purpose that our students learn about making
a positive difference for a greater good.</p>
<p>Our staff community stands strong, embracing the vision for 2025, drawing
strength from one another as we grow together in this learning community.
Thank you for your continued trust and partnership as we embark on this
exciting journey of growth and discovery.</p>
<p>Let us move forward together, <strong>rooted in strength, growing together.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mrs Shirley Lee <br>Principal <br>Bukit Batok Secondary School</strong>
