### Notable Events

  

PSG also hopes to build a community of parents who lend support to one another during our children’s teenage years. Other than the sharing of parenting resources at our Whatsapp Chat groups created for each level, we foster this friendship through regular meetings and events. During such events, we also encourage parent-child bonding through meaningful time spent together.

  

**PSG meetings** \- Interactive meeting with PSG, School leaders and staff, Ministry of Social and Family Family Matters @ School Coordinator and parents.

**Dialogue in the Dark** – Students and parents learn about how the visually-handicapped carry about their daily activities by entering a pitch-dark room.  During the journey, they are guided by a blind guide.  It is indeed a lesson of empathy learnt for all the participants!

**Workshops** – Students and parents build rapport by creating unique crafts such as terrarium, and learning from experts lifeskills such as self-defence Kapap skills.  Each year, PSG also conducts a workshop to prepare a little gift of appreciation for our teachers and staff of BBSS.  This is our little way of saying “Thank You” for the selfless sacrifices teachers and staff have made for our children.
