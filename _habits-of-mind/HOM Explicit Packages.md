# HOM Explicit Packages

The HOM packages are designed by BBSS staff. The students' packages are for your viewing.


Our BBSS Mission is ‘To nurture BBSSians to be self-directed learners with abundance mentality.’

In line with our BBSS mission of abundance mentality, the HOM Teaching Resource Packages are shared with all free-of-charge.


If you would like to download the teachers' packages, do write to Mdm Lin Jia Hui, our HOM Overall in-charge/Head of Department for Curriculum Design @ ([lin\_jia\_hui@schools.gov.sg](mailto:lin_jia_hui@schools.gov.sg)) for the password. Kindly include the name of the educational institution and country you are from. The information required is for our record. Thank you for your interest in our HOM Explicit Teaching Packages.
