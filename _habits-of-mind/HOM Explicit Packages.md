# HOM Explicit Packages

The HOM packages are designed by BBSS staff. The students' packages are for your viewing.


Our BBSS Mission is ‘To nurture BBSSians to be self-directed learners with abundance mentality.’

In line with our BBSS mission of abundance mentality, the HOM Teaching Resource Packages are shared with all free-of-charge.


If you would like to download the teachers' packages, do write to Mdm Lin Jia Hui, our HOM Overall in-charge/Head of Department for Curriculum Design @ ([lin\_jia\_hui@schools.gov.sg](mailto:lin_jia_hui@schools.gov.sg)) for the password.
