# Launch of the W7 2022 Euphoria for the Arts Exhibition: A Kaleidoscope of Talents

We are pleased to inform that West 7 (W7) Aesthetics Networked Learning Community (NLC) is organising our 6th instalment of our annual arts exhibition entitled Euphoria VI with the theme “A Kaleidoscope of Talents”. 

The exhibition aims to provide students and staff from the W7 cluster of schools a platform to express and celebrate their artistic talents and creative voices, and will be launched on Thursday, 13 October 2022 in our W7 Euphoria for the Arts Website (<a href="https://w7euphoria.edu.sg/" target="_blank">https://w7euphoria.edu.sg/</a>).

Visit us to support our aspiring talents as you immerse yourselves in our kaleidoscope of artworks.
