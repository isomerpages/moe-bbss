**Our history**  
 The Air Rifle Club was established in 1989. It has undergone several changes from an underground shooting range to the rooftop facility over the Indoor Sports Hall. Once again, we will be making improvements and come Quarter 4 2019, the range will be upgraded into an air-conditioned shooting range to enhance the training comfort of our shooters.    
  
**Our Sport**  
Competitive shooting requires one to persevere, be reflective and patient. It is not about physical strength and power, but composure, mental strength and concentration. Shooters learn to focus on their goals, and work hard. They reflect on their mistakes, correct and make changes and enjoy success doing it. Patience – waiting for the right moment before attempting a shot – is the key to succeeding in this sport. Mental strength, good decision-making skills and teamwork are also key attributes of our shooters.  
  
Every year, our shooters participate in the National School Games (NSG). From 2019 onwards, we also began participating in both the NUS Invitational Shoot and the NTU Invitational Shoot. In 2021, a team of Secondary 2 girls won 2nd place in the NTU Invitational Shoot Team category. In addition, one of the Secondary 2 girls managed to achieve 3rd place in the Individual category.
