### 

**Strengths and Objectives:**  

Team Spirit, Dedication, Perseverance and Gratitude defines the BBSS Softball Team.

Team Spirit \- Whenever the players face any difficulty, whether or not it is softball related, they will always be willing to lend a helping hand or a listening ear to. This team spirit has taught them to be appreciative of one another and build camaraderie which translates into a stronger and more formidable team on the field.

Dedication \- As our team motto goes 'One team, One dream', the players train and play hard together, laugh and cry together. An individual can only go so far in life alone before they realise they actually need assistance form others and it is important to understand that a team maximizes the strengths and brings out the best of each individual.

Perseverance \- As a sports CCA, the players undergo strenuous training that consists of basic throwing, catching and batting skills as well as physical fitness exercises. They also learn how to react fast to different game situations that can affect how they play and the outcome of an entire game. Likewise, it is also constantly being emphasized that this trait should also be applied to other aspects of their lives such as their academics. In short, the players learn that there is no short cut to success and as long as they persevere to do their best, they will be able to achieve their targets.

Gratitude \- Gratitude makes you appreciate what you have instead of what you do not have. It is important to be grateful to people who have helped and guided you on your journey, especially those who have endured the toughest times with you.
