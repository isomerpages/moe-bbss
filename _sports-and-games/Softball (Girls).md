<h3><strong>Strengths and Objectives:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Team Spirit, Dedication, Perseverance and Gratitude defines the BBSS Softball Team.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Team Spirit&nbsp;</strong>- Whenever the players face any difficulty,
whether or not it is softball related, they will always be willing to lend
a helping hand or a listening ear to. This team spirit has taught them
to be appreciative of one another and build camaraderie which translates
into a stronger and more formidable team on the field.</p>
<p><strong>Dedication&nbsp;</strong>- As our team motto goes 'One team, One
dream', the players train and play hard together, laugh and cry together.
An individual can only go so far in life alone before they realise they
actually need assistance form others and it is important to understand
that a team maximizes the strengths and brings out the best of each individual.</p>
<p><strong>Perseverance&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;As a sports CCA, the players
undergo strenuous training that consists of basic throwing, catching and
batting skills as well as physical fitness exercises. They also learn how
to react fast to different game situations that can affect how they play
and the outcome of an entire game. Likewise, it is also constantly being
emphasized that this trait should also be applied to other aspects of their
lives such as their academics. In short, the players learn that there is
no short cut to success and as long as they persevere to do their best,
they will be able to achieve their targets.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude</strong>&nbsp;- Gratitude makes you appreciate what
you have instead of what you do not have. It is important to be grateful
to people who have helped and guided you on your journey, especially those
who have endured the toughest times with you.</p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
