In addition, players are taught a variety of tactics which are suited for different conditions they are excpected to contribute in terms of the setting up of plays during games.</p>
  

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hard work</b>&nbsp;is the basic foundation of our team and also influences the programmes planned for our players. Body conditioning and gym training are carried out by our championship winning coach, Coach Tan Lip Loong and certified gym trainer, Mr Chia Kwek Fah. This is to ensure our players' physical development is well taken care of, given that the players are at a crucial period for their physical development.</p>

Our players are expected to be&nbsp;<b>disciplined</b>&nbsp;and behave as role models for their peers during practice and lesson time. Leadership opportunities and guidance are given to players to lead and grow at the same time.</p>
