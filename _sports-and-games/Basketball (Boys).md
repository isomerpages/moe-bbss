<p style="text-align: justify;">Our players undergo training that is similar to <b>professional</b> players by focusing on the fundamentals skills such as passing, shooting, dribbling and tactics analysis. Each component drill is designed specially to improve our players and to ensure that they are ready to carry out their plays to perfection during games. In addition, players are taught a variety of tactics which are suited for different conditions they are excpected to contribute in terms of the setting up of plays during games.</p>
  

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hard work</b> is the basic foundation of our team and also influences the programmes planned for our players. Body conditioning and gym training are carried out by our championship winning coach, Coach Tan Lip Loong and certified gym trainer, Mr Chia Kwek Fah. This is to ensure our players' physical development is well taken care of, given that the players are at a crucial period for their physical development.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our players are highly valued as student athletes and their character development is of utmost importance to ours. Our players are expected to be <b>disciplined</b> and behave as role models for their peers during practice and lesson time. Leadership opportunities and guidance are given to players to lead and grow at the same time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Opportunities are abundant beyond game time. Our players are developed in Education and Career Guidance (ECG) pathways by our team's very own Future Stars Programme. Career talks on sports related post-secondary school pathways are introduced to our players. Furthermore, we work very closely with government organizations such as ActiveSG and Team Nila to promote volunteerism and professional sports exposure for our players. Our players have the opportunity to attend sponsored events such as the finals of ASEAN Basketball League (ABL) and support our very own Singapore Slingers and HSBC Rugby Seven (Category 1 tickets).</p>
