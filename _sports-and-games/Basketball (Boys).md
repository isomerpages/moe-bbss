<p>Our players undergo training that is similar to&nbsp;<strong>professional</strong>&nbsp;players
by focusing on the fundamentals skills such as passing, shooting, dribbling
and tactics analysis. Each component drill is designed specially to improve
our players and to ensure that they are ready to carry out their plays
to perfection during games. In addition, players are taught a variety of
tactics which are suited for different conditions they are excpected to
contribute in terms of the setting up of plays during games.</p>
<p><strong>Hard work</strong>&nbsp;is the basic foundation of our team and
also influences the programmes planned for our players. Body conditioning
and gym training are carried out by our championship winning coach, Coach
Tan Lip Loong and certified gym trainer, Mr Chia Kwek Fah. This is to ensure
our players' physical development is well taken care of, given that the
players are at a crucial period for their physical development.</p>
<p>Our players are highly valued as student athletes and their character
development is of utmost importance to ours. Our players are expected to
be&nbsp;<strong>disciplined</strong>&nbsp;and behave as role models for
their peers during practice and lesson time. Leadership opportunities and
guidance are given to players to lead and grow at the same time.</p>

<p>Opportunities are abundant beyond game time. Our players are developed
in Education and Career Guidance (ECG) pathways by our team's very own
Future Stars Programme. Career talks on sports related post-secondary school
pathways are introduced to our players. Furthermore, we work very closely
with government organizations such as ActiveSG and Team Nila to promote
volunteerism and professional sports exposure for our players. Our players
have the opportunity to attend sponsored events such as the finals of ASEAN
Basketball League (ABL) and support our very own Singapore Slingers and
HSBC Rugby Seven (Category 1 tickets).</p>
