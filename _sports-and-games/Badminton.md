The Badminton CCA aims to promote participation in Badminton as a sport for life and to nurture students who are imbued with strong values and a strong sense of self-discipline. The CCA provides students with the opportunity to learn the proper skills and techniques of the sport, helping them internalise school values in the process. Students pick up other traits such as resilience, endurance and the importance of persistence. Through the training, they are groomed in the spirit of fair play, teamwork and sportsmanship. In pursuing sporting excellence through their efforts, students will have opportunities to represent the school at various competitions.

Our students train tremendously hard to improve their skills, either through rigorous workout sessions or in friendly competitions. Students are encouraged to explore doubles as well as singles play to boost individual character and teamwork skills.

The CCA strives to get players to **_play for fun_** (enjoying the game), _**play for fitness**_ (develop them into athletes), _and **play for life**_ (making badminton their lifelong sport and recreational activity).
