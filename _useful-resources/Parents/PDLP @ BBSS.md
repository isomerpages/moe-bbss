# PDLP @ BBSS

Dear Parents,

  

<p style="text-align: justify;">At MOE's Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) or all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">BBSS has set up a page on PDLP where you can find more detailed information in relation to BBSS. Click <a href="https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/bbsspdlp/pdlp" target="_blank">here</a> to find out more.</p>
